    "description": "This responsive web app helps to schedule to water plants or when is good to change the soil based on the data on database. It scan the plant and you will find the name of plant. Also, you can post the picture of your plant and share it in the application and comment under other posts.In this project for authentication we used firebase and firestore as database. Also we used vanilla javascript and Sass for styling. In this project we used Agile method and thrello ot track the progress and tasks.",
    "features": "The first feature is schedule to water plants or when is good tochange the soil based on the data on database. The second feature is scan the plant and with an api you will find the name of plant. The third feature is you can post the picture of your plant and share it in the application and comment under other posts.",

    "description": "we used Jira to plan, assign, report, and manage tasks with the members. Jira’s total transparency and custom reporting options are more sophisticated  than other platforms. Our development team used GitHub to host codes and keep track of the platform bugs.\nWe chose the ReactJS framework as it simplifies front-end development thanks to its flexibility and component reusability. We also used the ReactQuery library for data fetching, caching, and updating the server state in the React application.For styling, SASS (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets) is a popular CSS pre-processor that makes styling much fast, structured, and easy to maintain.Additionally, we used Auth service from Firebase for user authentication management. \nWe picked Node.js as our framework for back-end service. We also decided to use Express Js to easily create REST APIs and endpoint exposure. \nMongoDB is the NoSQL database that is used, as it allows flexible data schema and high performance. In addition, we used Firebase Storage for our file-saving necessities.\nNetlify and Render are the choices for front and back-end deployment. Both tools allow creating an easy CI/CD pipeline by selecting the branch we need in GitHub. Postman serves as the testing tool for REST APIs.",
    "features": "Students can share their school projects, and businesses can share their ideas to work collaboratively.\nBoth students and businesses can explore our project library for their desired projects and ideas. \nStudents can directly apply to business projects simply by filling out a form.",

    "description": "This project is a web application that assists pharmacists in delivering medicine to customers. It has a portal, that allows pharmacists to manage orders, select delivery dates, frequencies, and times. You have implemented the project using JavaScript and SASS.\nIn this project, I likely utilized JavaScript to handle user interactions, validate inputs, manage order data, and perform any dynamic behavior on the portal.\nBy incorporating JavaScript and SASS into this project, I've enhanced the functionality and styling of the web portal for pharmacists, enabling them to manage orders effectively and streamline the delivery process for customers.",

    "title": "Crowd Ease",
    "date": "April2023",
    "description": "In this project we selected React Native library to develop Crowd Ease because it is a popular cross-platform for building mobile applications, which allowed us to develop for both Android and iOS.For authentication, we used Firebase Authentication, a secure and easy-to-use service. We implemented the user and password, Google, and Apple authentication.To enhance the app’s type safety and help prevent errors we used TypeScript, a strongly typed superset of JavaScript. To make the navigation between screens for users efficient and customizable we used React Navigation. React Query was used to handle data fetching, caching, and state management, ensuring the app was fast and responsive. To make the code clean, structured, and easy to maintain we configured ESLint and Prettier rules. \nOn the backend, we used Node.js to power the app’s server side. We followed the same standard by implementing TypeScript for type detection in the backend as well as in the front end. We used Express.js to make the creation process of REST API and endpoints exposure more efficient. The JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for secure authentication and authorization, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive parts of the app. \nOur database of choice was MongoDB, a NoSQL database designed for handling large amounts of unstructured data, making it an excellent choice for small projects with dynamic data needs. To simplify connecting the backend with the database and to provide a schema-based solution for managing data, we utilized Mongoose. Mongoose simplifies creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data from MongoDB, reducing the boilerplate code needed to interact with the database. Another reason we used Mongoose is that it makes it easier to enforce consistency and structure in your data, ensuring that we are constantly working with data that adheres to a particular format or structure; considering that we are using TypeScript, this would be another helpful tool. Using MongoDB with Mongoose can help you build a more efficient, scalable, and maintainable application, even for a small project, due to its many features and benefits. \nWe selected Amazon Web Services (AWS) as our hosting platform for the back-end system. By using AWS and Postman in combination, we were able to ensure reliable hosting and comprehensive testing of our back-end system",
